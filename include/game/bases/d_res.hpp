/**
 * @brief An archive resource management class.
 * @ingroup bases
 * @details
 * The dRes_c class manages resource archives ( @p \.arc files). It does so by storing multiple
 * @ref info_c "archive holders". The class is instantiated automatically by dResMng_c, which provides
 * higher level access.
 *
 * ## Path Notes
 * Resource paths are subject to the following restrictions:
 * - The @p \.arc extension is appended automatically to archive names and therefore must not be included.
 * - The @p / character is prepended automatically to archive paths and therefore must not be included.
 * - Archive names (excluding the file extension) cannot exceed 32 characters.
 * - Full paths to archive files (including the appended extension and prepended slash) cannot exceed 80
 * characters.
 * - Full paths to resources inside an archive should not exceed 250 characters.
 *
 * ## Opening Archives
 * Use the ::setRes function to open an archive. For opening multiple archives at once, see
 * @ref dResMng_c::setRes "the dResMng_c equivalent".
 *
 * @note Many kinds of assets are loaded automatically, therefore doing so manually is not necessary.
 * These include:
 * - Stages
 * - Tilesets
 * - Backgrounds
 * - Actor resources
 * - Worldmaps and their resources
 *
 * ### Notes for BRRES Resources
 * The game automatically handles the initialization of any BRRES files inside an archive, as long as the
 * parent directory of the file is named @p g3d .
 *
 * ### Notes for Layout Resources
 * For layout archives, it's recommended to use the
 * @ref LytBase_c::ReadResource3 "dedicated LytBase_c functions" instead of this class.
 *
 * ## Loading Archives
 * Use the ::syncAllRes function to perform the actual archive file loading. The function will return
 * @p true until all opened archives are loaded successfully.
 *
 * ## Getting Archive Resources
 * Use the ::getRes function to obtain a resource inside a specific archive once it has been loaded.
 * Overloads are provided to obtain the size of the resource and optionally detect compressed resources.
 *
 * If the file could not be found under the archive, a warning is printed to the console.
 * Use ::getResSilently if this behaviour is undesired (such as with an optional file).
 *
 * @note No overload for ::getResSilently with compression support is available.
 *
 * ### Compressed Resources
 * While the @ref getRes(const char*, const char*, unsigned long*, int*) const "getRes" function can detect
 * compression and return the decompressed data size, it does not actually perform the decompression itself.
 * This can be achieved by calling the @ref copyRes(const void*, void*, int, int) "copyRes" function with
 * the compressed data and the compression type returned by the previous function, plus a buffer to store
 * the decompressed data into.
 *
 * @note Only LZ77 compression is supported.
 *
 * ## Deleting Archives
 * Use the ::deleteRes function to mark an archive as no longer needed by the calling entity.
 * This ensures that archives no longer in use are properly disposed of.
 *
 * ## Unused Content
 * - ::mSetCallback is an unused callback for when an archive is added to the class. It was probably
 * used to debug resource loading.

    /**
     * @brief An archive holder.
     * @details
     * info_c is a high-level interface to resource archives ( @p \.arc files). It is generally not accessed
     * directly, but is managed by the outer dRes_c class. It wraps the functionalities of
     * mDvd_mountMemArchive_c and EGG::Archive to simplify the loading and iteration of resource archives.
     *
     * ## Loading an Archive
     * Use the ::set function to manually schedule an archive for loading. If successful, a
     * @ref mpDvdCmd "file loading command" is generated and queued to continue the loading process
     * in the background.
     *
     * ## Checking Progress
     * Use the ::setRes function to query the @ref LOAD_STATUS_e "archive's loading state". Once the
     * loading process is completed, the @ref mpDvdCmd "command" is deleted and the
     * @ref mpFiles "archive's resource list" is built using the provided callback.
     *
     * ## Archive Disposal
     * Each archive holder features a @ref ::mRefCount "reference count", which acts as a garbage disposal
     * mechanism: each time the archive is requested the count increases, while it decreases when its deletion
     * is requested. When the counter reaches zero (or the holder is deleted), the archive is automatically
     * @ref cleanup "disposed".
